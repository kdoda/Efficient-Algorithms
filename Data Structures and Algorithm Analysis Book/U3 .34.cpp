/*A linked list contains a cycle if, starting from some node p, following a sufficient
number of next links brings us back to node p. p does not have to be the first nodein the list.
Assume that you are given a linked list that contains N nodes; however,
the value of N is unknown.
a. Design an O(N) algorithm to determine if the list contains a cycle. You may use
O(N) extra space.
 b. Repeat part (a), but use only O(1) extra space. (Hint: Use two iterators that are
initially at the start of the list but advance at different speeds.)*/
